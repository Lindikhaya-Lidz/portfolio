                <h3>Creativity</h3>
                <p>
                   This section is a cosmetic section, meaning it isn't supposed 
                   to exist. But anyways I justed wanted to express my views on creativity cause
                   it seems like these days creativity is at the center of almost every facet of
                   our lives, therefore I think creativity in general should be explored and this exploration
                   should be a systematic and rigour exploration, in which we don't get excited by the results of creativity,
                   but rather we get excited by the source of creativity, so that we can wield it at our will.
                   <br>
                   <span class='more'>
                   I believe that creativity is a force that arises when all of the blockages to creativity are removed,
                   i think by finding these blockages we automatically find the source of creativity as well.And these blockages
                   are different depending on the particular situations that an individual is in,
                   therefore the is no mechanical solution to the problems of creativity, infact I oppose
                   these ideas of finding solutions to problems cause these ideas imply that the solution is
                   independent of the problem, in which the solution is always somehow hidden in the deep roots of the problem
                   therefore its impossible to find the solution without being friends with the problem, I guess I shoul stop now.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My Name is Lidz Maqolwana and I enjoy writing web programmes for almost
               the same reasons as others do, which is as frontend developers we get to play, play around
               with animations, styles, hiding and showing parts of the UI when neccessary its like playing peekaboo
               with the users its quite an amazing field to be in.<br>I'm a huge fan of inquiry and exploration,
               in any field I think its important to question prevailing dogmas, cause most of our ideas on how things
               are done or how they should be are not based on truth, so inquiry and exploration exposes those untruths.<br>I would
               love to write more about myself and what interests me, but its almost impossible to capture who I'am in words, I think
               we as people can only experience who we are because who we are is mostly based on how we feel about thing, and therefore its impossible to accuratly discribe 
               feelings, thats why I cant continue writing about myself unless you prefer lies, please forgive.
